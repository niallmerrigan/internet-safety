# Internet Safety for Parents
Collection of links and information for parents on Internet Safety

# What is important to know
Talking to your children about their internet usage is important. The controls listed below are support tools to help your kids
manage their time and limit their exposure to inappropiate content and other potential security problems.

You cannot control everything so maintaining a good dialog with them is vital. Most parents feel they are not technical enough to
understand what their kids are doing online so asking questions to help them teach you helps the dialogue mature.  

Finally, treat the internet as both a tool and a weapon much like scissors. Educate your kids and yourself around the various benefits
and dangers. There is a lot of information available from the various state services such as [BufDir](https://www.bufdir.no/foreldrehverdag/ungdom/digital-hverdag/skadelig-innhold/), [Medietilsynet](https://www.medietilsynet.no/digitale-medier/barn-og-medier/) and [Politiet](https://www.politiet.no/rad/trygg-nettbruk/delbart/) that are
very good and provide excellent guidance to parents.

# Why are most services limited to persons 13 years old and older

The reason for 13 year old limit is due to COPPA, the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, which is an American law, brought in
to protect the privacy of users under the age of 13. COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services 
directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge 
that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.  

It does not mean that the content is appropriate to 13 year olds. It just says that companies need to make sure that people under
13 years old have stronger protection on information being gathered about this.  

For parents, it is important to understand that the content on various platforms may be inappropriate or undmoderated.

# Video game ratings and online play

Most video games released since 2003 in European markets have been rated by [PEGI](https://pegi.info/) (Pan European Game Information). This ratings system
is now used by 41 countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. 
PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and nine content descriptors that advise the suitability of a game for a certain age range 
based on the game's content. The age rating is not intended to indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it.

Game ratings are based on content.

# About Discord

Discord is a chat platform that is used extensively by the gaming community, The popularity of Discord makes its a target for scammers, hackers and and spammers. And
due to the amount of functionality it offers such as text chat, voice, video and screen sharing it can open up your children to different threats and attacks.

THe most common scam is people trying to steal your game acocunt and it is especially common on servers dedicated to a particular game.  

The scam works as follows.

You will be contacted via private message by someone claiming that you will need to log into your game account via the link thta they sent you. They might say that you will
get free items, additional in game currency or very hard to find items due to their link, whatever it takes to get the person to log in. The page that they are sending you 
to is a fake page that looks the real one but is designed to copy your details to the scammer. This is known as phishing.

Once they have your log in details, they will empty your account of anything valuable and lock you out thus losing access to your account. It may not be possible to reset or 
recover any items that you have lost. 

Parents should advise their children not to click the links on private messages from anyone and if they get them to have you check with them to understand what is happening.
